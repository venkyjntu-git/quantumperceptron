# Project Title

Quantum Perceptron

## Description

Implementation of perceptron using a Hybrid approach
Hybrid Classical-Quantum Approach: This "Quantum Perceptron" (VQC) is a hybrid algorithm, leveraging the best of both worlds:

Quantum computers excel at processing and transforming data in complex, high-dimensional quantum spaces.

Classical computers efficiently perform the iterative optimization (learning) loop to find the ideal quantum circuit parameters.
